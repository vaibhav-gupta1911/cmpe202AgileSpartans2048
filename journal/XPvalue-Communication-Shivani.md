# XP Core Value - Communication - Shivani Reddy

## Week 1 (April 6th - April 12th)
 - In the first week, all of us met and introduced ourselves. We had a face-to-face communication on what has to be chosen for project, each of us have interacted well to come up with an idea for final project and then we decided on 2048.
 - We met very often to make sure that everyone is on same page.
 - Created a standbot for regular communication and scrum model at 4 P.M everyday to ensure that everyone communicates and brings out if there are any blockers.
 - We have discussed on what patterns can be applied to the game and shortlisted few.
 - Communication here helped us to evaluate each other idea and helped us come up with final idea for project.
 

## Week 2 (April 13th - April 19th)

 - In the 2nd week, we have divided patterns among us after having a meeting on what everyone wants to take.
 - Each of us have developed a class diagram and explained their approach to others to get a foresight of any possible flaw in the 
 implementation.
 - Communication with other team mates on our approach and analysis has helped us to find the corner cases pointed by people in meeting and final design for patterns
 was made after the entire team's approval.
 - On a regular basis, we communicated on issues in merge and potential bugs which has helped us resolve them faster.
 
## Week 3 (April 20th - April 26th)
 - In the 3rd week, we have started implementing patterns for our game individually and given demos of our pattern.
 - We seeked each other help for integrating code and running the game.
 - We tracked the progress of our patterns and current state of the game often to make sure we finish the project in anticipated
 time before deadline.
 - Took the peer reviews for implemented code and discussed with them to fix the review comments.
 - Communication between us have made us come up with optimized and cleaner code for relevant use-cases.
 
 

## Week 4 (April 27th - May 3rd)
 - This week we have placed all our code in place and integrated it by sitting together and taking inputs on conflicts to make sure that
 we don't break any functionality.
 - Performed AST Testing.
