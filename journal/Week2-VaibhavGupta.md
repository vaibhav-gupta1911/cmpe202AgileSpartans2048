## Vaibhav Gupta

### Finished Last Week 
- Task1: Created 4 arrow buttons on the 2048 game UI that will take command from Mouse inputs and user can play through them.
- Task2: Implemented "Prototype Design Pattern" to provide cloned Buttons on each button move as creating 
  NEW repetive buttons(2,4,8....2048) would be costly as game board only needs their prototypes.
- Task3: Came up with idea to implement Strategy pattern for (Mouse vs Keyboard), but we are not sure hence will finalize after concerning with Professor on (04/27/2019)


### Planned Next Week
- Task1: Testing the implemented pattern.
- Task2: If finalized on Strategy pattern will implement that.
- Task3: Complete the Mouse functionality to play game.
- Task4- Check if we could implement new pattern.

### Problems
- We faced challange to call one actor from another actor, after much RnD able to find the solution. 
  The issue was a temporary bloacker, but it was resolved we were back on track.
  
### Time Spend

- Task1: 6 hrs
- Task2: 8 hrs
- Task3: 4 hrs (for analysis and discussions)

### XP Core Value : FEEDBACK.

Team did a lot of brainstorming during this whole week. The thoughts and feedback we shared with each other helped us to understand the 
game design flow well and also how one design should be implemeneted without breaking others. 
The feedback also help us in improving our codes and sometimes implementing design pattern at most appropraite place and in appropriate way.
